# Maze-Game
It's a simple Maze Game which was in craze years ago.So I thought of recreating a basic HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT based game.



RULES TO FOLLOW WHILE PLAYING THE GAME:-
1)The game now consists of only two level🎚️ with a little surprise.
2)Simply drag the mouse🖱️ from START anf follow the path slowly.
3)Do not touch the borders of the maze otherwise you are wasted and you need to start again😢.
4)After completion of levels give a little tap on your bac🥳.
